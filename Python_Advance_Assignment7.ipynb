        "First, try clause is executed i.e. the code between try and except clause. If there is no exception, then only try clause will run, except clause is finished. If any exception occured, try clause will be skipped and except clause will run. If any exception occurs, but the except clause within the code doesn’t handle it, it is passed on to the outer try statements. If the exception left unhandled, then the execution stops. A try statement can have more than one except clause\n",
